# Structural Design Pattern
<h4><li>Structural design patterns are concerned with how classes and objects can be composed, to form larger structures.</li></h4>
<h4><li>The structural design patterns simplifies the structure by identifying the relationships.</li> </h4>
<h4><li>These patterns focus on, how the classes inherit from each other and how they are composed from other classes.</li></h4>

<h3><a href="bridge pattern">2- Bridge Pattern </a></h3>
<li>
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large

hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be
developed independently of each other.

<h3><a href="composite pattern">3- Composite Pattern </a></h3>

objects into tree structures and then work with these
structures as if they were individual objects.</li>

<h3><a href="decorator patrern">4- Decorator patrern </a></h3>
<li>
Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach
new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside
special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.</li>

<h3><a href="facade pattern">5- Facade patrern </a></h3>
<li>
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified
interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of
classes

<h3><a href="flyweight pattern">6- Flyweight patrern </a></h3>
<li>
Flyweight is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more
objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common
parts of state between multiple objects instead of keeping all
of the data in each object
